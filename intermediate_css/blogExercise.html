  <h1>Attack of the Cat <span>Blog</span></h1>

  <h4>January 30 2019</h4>

  <h2>Attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened</h2>

    <p>Hiiiiiiiiii feed me now eat half my food and ask for more or get suspicious of own shadow then go play with toilette paper and paw at beetle and eat it before it gets away, chase ball of string. Pretend you want to go out but then don't lick the other cats. I can haz murr i hate humans they are so annoying. Wake up human for food at 4am eat all the power cords meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans yet dismember a mouse and then regurgitate parts of it on the family room floor make muffins, yet you are a captive audience while sitting on the toilet, pet me, immediately regret falling into bathtub.</p>
    
    <p>I'm going to lap some water out of my master's cup meow. Decide to want nothing to do with my owner today hide when guests come over. Meow in empty rooms hiss at vacuum cleaner eats owners hair then claws head. Leave hair on owner's clothes stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring sniff sniff fooled again thinking the dog likes me but hiss at vacuum cleaner scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food. Scamper sniff catnip and act crazy fall asleep upside-down eats owners hair then claws head yet cat not kitten around for stare out the window.</p>

  <h2>You call this cat food wack the mini furry mouse</h2>

    <p>I like fish i bet my nine lives on you-oooo-ooo-hooo. Find something else more interesting. Be superior eat too much then proceed to regurgitate all over living room carpet while humans eat dinner chase dog then run away wake up wander around the house making large amounts of noise jump on top of your human's bed and fall asleep again i'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?!</p>

    <p>Leap into the air in greatest offense!. Pet my belly, you know you want to; seize the hand and shred it!. Pet right here, no not there, here, no fool, right here that other cat smells funny you should really give me all the treats because i smell the best and omg you finally got the right spot and i love you right now fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy), rub against owner because nose is wet more napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting or lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep yet hack scratch the postman wake up lick paw wake up owner meow meow.</p>
